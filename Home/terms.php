                     to inform you of this prior to your purchase. If you have paid for the goods that 
                     are not available, a full refund will be given after mutual communication and

                     It is our motive that we sell what we show and say on the website. Hence, every 
                     possible care is taken into consideration to describe the goods as precisely and 
                     accurately as possible. However, the colours and designs may vary & are not
                     guaranteed 100% due to the photographic lenses & lighting. We advise you wash
                     the product separately, preferably dry clean, and also the embroidery and colours
                     might slightly differ from what it appears on the website after continuous usage
                     and washes.
